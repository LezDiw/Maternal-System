# Digitized Hospital-Based Maternal Care SystemProject 
## Overview
This project focuses on the development of a digitized hospital-based maternal care system. The primary goal is to leverage technology to enhance maternal health care delivery, thereby reducing maternal mortality rates. The system aims to provide a comprehensive, efficient, and accessible platform for managing maternal health information, from patient registration to post-natal care.
## Key Objectives
The system is designed to achieve the following key objectives:
Enhance Data Management
Create a centralized, digital database for all maternal health records, ensuring accuracy and easy access.
Improve Accessibility
Provide a user-friendly interface for healthcare providers to access patient information quickly and securely.Streamline Workflows
Automate and digitize key processes, such as appointment scheduling, test results tracking, and medication management.Support Decision-Making
Offer tools for data analysis and reporting to help healthcare administrators identify trends and make informed decisions.
## Project Timeline 
The project was executed over a period of 16 weeks, with the following key phases
Literature Review & Case Study Analysis: Weeks 1-4
Conceptual Framework & Research Methodology: Weeks 5-8
Data Collection & Analysis: Weeks 9-12
Prototype Development: Weeks 11-14
Report Writing: Weeks 15-16
