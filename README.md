Abstract
Human failure (non-adherence to check-ups and protocols) and health care systems failures remain a leading cause of maternal mortality, revealing the limitations of traditional awareness methods in the maternal care that lack interactivity and personalization. The most common complications that arise from the abovementioned causes and are never monitored include eclampsia and puerperal sepsis and careless abortions. All these can be detected early and prevented if the client is well monitored but due to awareness constraints among other reasons they end up causing death. This study aims to design and evaluate a Hospital Based Integrated and Informative Maternal Care system that improves expectant women engagement with other women, knowledge acquisition, and service acquisition through interactive system and real-time feedback from both medically certified personnel and artificial intelligence agents. The research follows mixed-methods design involving surveys, system usage metrics, and qualitative interviews. The study investigates how digital awareness and integrated systems can reduce maternal mortality outcomes. The results are expected to inform the development of better self-aware systems for all the health-related complications that lead to deaths but can be prevented by clients and medical professionals being more informed and the hospitals systems and departments being integrated to avoid loss or delay in transfer of important information on clients. It is also expected to improve hospital culture as an organization.

Definition of Terms
Maternal Mortality - Death of a woman during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days after termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.
Ubiquitous – Present, appearing, or found everywhere.
Portogram - A graphical record of the progress of labour over time, monitoring key maternal and foetal parameters.
Direct obstetric causes – Complications arising from the pregnant state (pregnancy, labour, and the puerperium), from interventions, omissions, incorrect treatment, or from a chain of events resulting from any of these.
Haemorrhage – Excessive or profuse bleeding.
Eclampsia – Occurrence of seizures or coma in a pregnant woman with pre-eclampsia, with no other cause for the seizures.
Obstructed Labour - Labour where the baby cannot pass through the birth canal despite strong uterine contractions.
Partograph - a vital graphical tool used in labour monitoring to record key data over time, enabling healthcare providers to assess the progress of labour, maternal well-being, and foetal status, and to detect potential complications early. It helps in making informed decisions about interventions, such as labour augmentation or necessary referrals.  
CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background of the Problem
Medical sector has always been trusted to be the most organized entity of all other with only the best offered to serve as professionals in that field. It also has the widest range of operations ranging from when a life is started to when it ends. This makes it hard to cover all bases in the sector. The clients themselves sometimes do not make it easier on the professionals in the sector to do their jobs promptly and on time. The maternity area also happens to have a lot of challenges scaling from the client side to the professionalism side and to the national and international health care system wholistically. The pregnancy mortality rate has been showing a lot of improvement since the 2000s but also a decline since the 2010s. The mortality rate can still be scaled down to avoid losing more mothers and unborn children and the pain it causes to their relatives and friends.
While this study aims to establish a strong relationship between the maternal mortality rate and expectant women failures (ignorance and unawareness) and healthcare systems failure (delays and lack of specialists) combined, assigning these deaths solely to "ignorance" or "system failure" can be an oversimplification, as these categories are often interconnected. For instance, a woman's lack of awareness about danger signs during pregnancy might be linked to inadequate community health education, a failure within the health system's outreach efforts. Similarly, delays in seeking care due to geographical barriers or lack of transport can be both a community/individual issue and a reflection of inadequate infrastructure, a health system challenge.
While it may be quite challenging to know if a death of an expectant mother was caused directly or indirectly since most of the symptoms are usually the same and due to the fact that a combination of factors leads to maternal mortality, the difference between the direct causes can sometimes have a very distinct difference. The mortalities due to expectant women failures (ignorance and unawareness) and healthcare systems failure (delays and lack of specialists) are often intertwined and data is not collected in the same manner, we can outline the trends in global, regional and local maternal mortality and the major contributing factors that fall under these two categories. The deaths caused directly are always higher than those caused indirectly. It is fairly important to note that these deaths not only affect the expectant mother and the unborn child(ren) but also their spouses, parents, siblings, and the community as a whole. Attempts in the past have been made to eradicate this problem but it has hit a decline for over 7 years now since 2015 and it is important to try again to relinquish that issue.
Globally, most of the pregnancy mortality can be accustomed to but not directly to the women failures and health care system failures in comparison to other causes like specialist error or underlying diseases in the expectant mother’s body according to WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA.

 
 
Figure 1.1 Global maternal deaths caused by expectant women and health care systems failure

In Africa, especially Sub-Saharan Africa which consistently accounts for the highest proportion of global maternal deaths. In 2020, approximately 70% of all maternal deaths occurred in this region. Trends in the maternal mortality indicate the major contributing factors fall under the two broader categories discussed in this study according to WHO, UNICEF, and UNFPA. Similar to the global maternal death rates table, a table for the analysis in the Sub-Saharan Africa can be modelled.
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.2 Sub-Saharan maternal deaths caused by expectant women and health care systems failure


In Kenya, a third world country where most of the developments are yet to peak, the maternal mortality is quite high because of the extra factors like infrastructure and poverty which makes a system that can be accessed and inform pregnant mothers without having to travel anywhere and doesn’t need any income an important tool to prevent life loss. If you compare the maternal death rates globally, in the Sub-Saharan and in Kenya, Kenya tends to lead.  The factors range from causes that could have been detected earlier and treated promptly to factors that were unpreventable.

This chapter presents a comprehensive review of the theoretical and conceptual frameworks, empirical studies, and existing research gaps in the domain of client and health care system fails. The aim is to identify how a digital informative system can be leveraged to develop more effective interventions that address the persistent issue of human error and health care error in maternal mortality.

1.2 Project Overview
This project aims to reduce the maternal deaths by at least 70% by helping expectant mothers be fully aware and informed of every thing pertaining their pregnancy from the beginning to the end. It aims to provide a platform where the data on the pregnancy safety and developments is only provided by qualified personnel but at the same time the questions they have would be answered in real-time. In addition to this, they would be allowed to meet and engage with each other on the platform and share support the best way they know.
The most tangible output for this project would be a reduced number of expectant women dying from causes that are preventable when discovered early. The intangible would be reduced maternal mortality rate and improved delivery rates of unborn children. The project would first capture the reviews from different mothers who already gave birth, then capture the information from the expectant mothers to get their greatest challenges during the pregnancy in order to determine if truly most of their challenges arose from unawareness. The family and friends would also be captured just to ensure we get the full picture of how big a problem maternal mortality is. The main personas would be the expectant mothers, medically qualified personnel, other mothers, friends and family of the expectant mothers. They would all be able to access the system and find out more about pregnancy.
With a digitized hospital based maternal care system, most if not all early and possibly detected complications during pregnancy can be scaled back and also prevent those that graduate to the final step of pregnancy(birth) causing death. The overall goal is to improve maternal health care access and maternal mortality outcomes in the community  
1.3 Problem Statement
Despite the widespread availability of clinics and hospitals and awareness programs for maternity many expectant mothers continue to lack the required quality maternal care in their pregnancy journey. Research shows that most expectant mothers rub off some symptoms of complications without knowing which later come to affect them and their unborn children. This it is mainly due to unawareness, stigmatization that still exists especially to the young and struggling expectant mothers, lack of fare and infrastructure to reach the clinics and hospitals and also lack of enough funds to acquire the best maternal health care among many reasons. This gap between theoretical knowledge of where the hospitals are and what is going on with the pregnancy and practical application of the knowledge and usage of the hospitals suggests a weakness in the design and delivery of traditional maternal care programs. Often, these programs are passive, relying on static content such as brochures, media or workshops that fail to capture user attention or simulate realistic threat scenarios. As a result, engagement and retention rates remain low, and expecting mothers are less likely to internalize or apply those concepts. Additionally, traditional approaches tend to adopt a one size fits all model that overlooks individual differences in learning styles, risk awareness, and job specific exposure to pregnancy threats. The lack of real time, contextual training further limits the ability of expectant mothers to respond effectively to emerging maternal risks. These shortcomings highlight the urgent need for more dynamic, interactive, and personalized maternal care solutions that actively engage users and adapt to their learning needs. In the past the maternal mortality rate was quite high globally and locally(background) but with the introduction of some of the awareness programs the reduced except they have had a decline in the past decade because the impact they cause have greatly fluctuated.
The traditional models consist of conventional approaches commonly adopted by health care system to raise maternity awareness. These include static learning materials such as workshops, media, brochures. While these methods serve a foundational role in introducing maternal concepts, they are largely passive and lack interactivity, leading to limited user engagement. A critical flaw in this model is the absence of adequate pre- and post-understanding assessments, which are essential for measuring the effectiveness of the understanding. Without these evaluations, organizations are unable to determine whether expectant mothers in the community have understood or retained the information presented. This results in several negative outcomes. First, knowledge retention among them is often inadequate, as static materials do not reinforce learning through real time application. Second, the lack of engaging content leads to reduced motivation to participate or apply information learned. Lastly, these traditional methods fail to offer contextual training that mirrors real world maternal scenarios expecting mothers face, further limiting their practical value. As a result, this model underscores the need for a more dynamic, behaviour driven approach to maternal awareness one that integrates interactivity, personalization, and ongoing evaluation to drive meaningful learning outcomes.
1.4 Purpose of the Study
This research aims to develop and evaluate a digitized hospital based maternal system to reduce the maternal mortality rate. The study will explore how interactive, AI-driven, and context-aware maternal care mechanisms can enhance user engagement and knowledge retention and behavioural outcomes in maternal education. Globally existing systems like Ampath focus mainly on educating the expectant mothers about the delivery and the pain relief methods they can use but they do not help them in identifying any underlying problems they might be facing. This is the same as the child.org and Linda mama initiatives. The proposed system focuses on providing additional features like real-time responses from doctors and AI agents, engaging with other mothers with more experience an those going through the same period, multilingual services and integration with qualified health care providers to provide guidance and clarity on matters.
1.5 Research Objectives
1.5.1. Primary Objective 
To reduce maternal mortality rate caused by direct and preventable causes by 70% using a digitized and informative maternal health care system in the next decade
1.5.2. Specific Objectives
1.	To investigate how digitized comprehensive awareness (e.g. real-time feedback) influence expectant mothers’ engagement and knowledge retention in eradicating maternal mortality.
2.	To develop a digitized maternal hospital-based health care tool that integrates qualified medical personnel to offer guidance and advice.
3.	To evaluate the effectiveness of interaction within expectant mothers and themselves in enhancing awareness of the challenges they may be facing and the support they offer each other.
1.6 Research Questions
1.	How does implementation of a digitized maternal health care system impact the timeliness and accuracy of the access to the required maternal care services? 
2.	How does the use of digital tools by healthcare providers impact the efficiency of communication with the expectant mothers within the maternal healthcare system?
3.	How does participation in interactive features of a digitized maternal healthcare system (e.g., forums, support groups, shared experiences) influence expectant mothers' awareness of potential pregnancy-related challenges and their symptoms?

1.7 Justification 
The research is conducted to be address the imperative need for improved maternal health care, address information gaps and isolation that expectant mothers face while at the same time emphasizing on the power of peer support and shared knowledge in improving maternal health.
The Imperative needs for Improved Maternal Healthcare - Maternal mortality and morbidity remain significant public health concerns in Kenya. While progress has been made, disparities in access to quality care, particularly in underserved areas, persist. Traditional maternal healthcare often lacks the reach and frequency of engagement needed to comprehensively address the multifaceted challenges expectant mothers face. These challenges can range from understanding pregnancy symptoms and potential complications to navigating emotional and psychological well-being.
Addressing Information Gaps and Isolation - Expectant mothers often encounter a wealth of information, some accurate and some not, leading to confusion and anxiety. Furthermore, feelings of isolation, especially for first-time mothers or those lacking strong social support networks, can negatively impact their mental and emotional health during a critical period. Traditional antenatal care visits, while essential for clinical monitoring, may not adequately address these informational and emotional needs.
The Power of Peer Support and Shared Knowledge - Evidence suggests that peer support plays a crucial role in improving maternal health outcomes. Connecting expectant mothers allows them to share experiences, learn from each other's coping mechanisms, and gain a better understanding of what to expect during pregnancy and postpartum. This shared knowledge can empower them to recognize potential warning signs, seek timely care, and feel less alone in their journey.
The introduction of a more informative tool for the pregnant women would improve the maternal health care system and it would address information gaps and eradicate the isolation most of them face. It would also envisage the power of peer support and shared knowledge in improving the maternal health outcomes. This is because they would overcome geographical barriers, facilitate continuous engagement, create a supportive community, enhance awareness of challenges, empower the expectant mothers through shared experience, promote early help seeking behavior among expectant mothers, and supplement traditional care. The technological developments over the past decades would make it possible to implement the system since it would be ubiquitous system and many ubiquitous gadgets exist today.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This literature review aims to explore the current landscape of digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems and their potential in combating direct causes of maternal deaths. Maternal mortality remains a significant global health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Direct obstetric causes, such as hemorrhage, infection, eclampsia, and obstructed labor, are often preventable with timely and appropriate interventions. This review will delve into how the increasing application of digital technologies within hospital settings can address these critical issues, ultimately contributing to the reduction of maternal deaths.
The integration of technology in healthcare has seen rapid growth across various domains. Within maternal health, this includes the use of electronic health records (EHRs) for improved data management and continuity of care, mobile health (mHealth) interventions for patient communication and education, telemedicine for remote consultations, and decision support systems for enhanced clinical decision-making. For instance, the application of chatbots and AI-powered tools is emerging as a promising avenue for providing timely information, appointment reminders, and even preliminary risk assessments for pregnant women. This review will explore the evidence surrounding the effectiveness and implementation of such technologies within the hospital environment.
The purpose of this literature review is to analyze existing research on digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems and their impact on addressing direct causes of maternal deaths. The objectives of this review are to:
•	Briefly outline the major direct causes of maternal deaths and their prevalence.
•	Investigate the application of various digital technologies within hospital settings to improve maternal health care delivery.
•	Analyze the evidence on the effectiveness of these digitized systems in preventing and managing direct obstetric complications.
•	Identify key benefits, challenges, and opportunities associated with the implementation of digitized maternal health care systems in hospitals.
•	Highlight potential areas for future research and development in this field.
2.2 Theoretical Review
2.2.1 Key Concepts and Variables
•	Maternal Mortality: The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.   
•	Direct Causes of Maternal Deaths: Obstetric complications resulting from the pregnant state, interventions, omissions, or incorrect treatment. These primarily include haemorrhage, infection, eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, obstructed labour, and complications of abortion.
•	Hospital-Based Maternal Health Care System: The infrastructure, processes, and personnel within a hospital setting dedicated to providing care to pregnant women, during childbirth, and in the postpartum period.
•	Digital Technologies in Healthcare: A broad range of electronic tools and systems used to store, share, analyse, and deliver health information and services. These include Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Mobile Health (mHealth) applications, Telemedicine platforms, and Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS).
•	Data-Driven Healthcare: The use of patient data, often collected and managed through digital systems, to inform clinical decisions, improve quality of care, and optimize healthcare delivery.
•	Accessibility: The ease with which pregnant women can access and utilize maternal health services, which can be improved through digital tools that facilitate communication, appointment scheduling, and remote consultations.
•	Quality of Care: The degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional knowledge. Digital systems can contribute to improved quality through standardized protocols, decision support, and enhanced monitoring.   
•	Timeliness of Intervention: The prompt delivery of appropriate medical care when complications arise during pregnancy, childbirth, or the postpartum period. Digital tools can facilitate early detection of risks and faster communication for timely interventions.
2.2.2 Key Theoretical Divisions in Digitized Maternal Health Care
The application of digital technologies in hospital-based maternal health care can be broadly categorized based on their primary function and underlying principles:
Data Management and Information System
This category focuses on technologies like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Hospital Information Systems (HIS). It works under the principle of centralized data storage, efficient information retrieval, data accuracy and enhanced communication. Its advantages include improved workflows, better care coordination, improved data monitoring and evaluation. It also has limitations such as implementation coats and data security breaches possibilities and furthermore it relies on a robust internet infrastructure and connectivity.
Communication and Remote Monitoring Technologies
This include mobile applications, SMS platforms and telemedicine solutions such as mHealth used for patient education, appointment reminders and remote consultations. It leverages mobile and internet technologies to bridge geographical barriers and enhances communication between patients and health care providers. Its strengths include increased accessibility to care, and improved patient engagement and adherence to recommendations. Some of its main weaknesses are the dependence on patient access to mobile devices and internet connectivity and potential digital literacy barriers. 
Decision Support and Artificial Intelligence Systems
This are tools that provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations, risk assessments and diagnostic support. It utilizes algorithms and data analysis to help health professionals make informed decisions. It enhances clinical decision making and reduces medical errors. On the other hand, most of them lack transparency on how the decisions were made and may introduce bias. They may have limitations in handling complex situations.
Understanding these theoretical divisions and their associated advantages and limitations is crucial for evaluating the potential and challenges of implementing digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems to effectively combat direct causes of maternal deaths. The subsequent sections of this review will build upon this theoretical framework by examining the evidence related to the application and impact of these different technological approaches.
2.3 Case Study Review
This section will explore various applications of digitized systems within hospital-based maternal health care, focusing on their relevance to combating direct causes of maternal deaths. It examines key implementations and briefly analyse their successes and potential shortcomings.
CASE STUDY 1: PregCare
This was developed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A model for low-risk pregnancies that reduce office visits while increasing virtual connections with doctors, nurses, and other providers, including self-care and a very sophisticated model of care for high-risk pregnancies supported by the newest technologies aimed at home based, self-care, and point of care service. It uses the hybrid E-Health perinatal model.
CASE STUDY 2: ANURA Mobile Application
AI based and uses the phone camera to measure the BP by scanning the face for 30 seconds. This provides a better predictive value for the development of preeclampsia (PE), and to identify women at risk of developing postpartum depression following PE. It collected data from cloud-based storage. AI prediction is used to combine mobile phone-generated data with other clinical data and biomarker profile, for a personalized risk classification.
CASE STUDY 3: PROMPTS (Jacaranda Health)
It has evolved from a simple SMS-based information service to a sophisticated AI-Powered platform. It initially sent reminders to expectant mothers about essential health check-ups and risk factors during pregnancy. It has since evolved to provide a more personalized support. It now integrates an advanced Swahili-speaking large language model (LLM). By leveraging AI, PROMPTS has significantly improved its response speed and accuracy, ensuring that expectant and new mothers receive timely, relevant, and actionable health information. The AI component categorizes and prioritizes messages, allowing help desk agents to quickly identify urgent cases and direct mothers to appropriate care facilities.
CASE STUDY 4: TRIM-AI 
This uses natural language processing (NLP) that allows machines to understand and analyse text messages and flag the ones that indicate a potential danger. The flagged messages are given a weighted risk score and then presented to a small team of help-desk agents who evaluate case emergency levels and decide which cases should be answered directly and which cases need immediate medical intervention.

2.3.1 Applications of Digitized Systems in Maternal Health Care
Digitized technologies are being applied across various aspects of hospital-based maternal health care, each with the potential to impact direct causes of mortality:
•	Enhanced Data Management and Electronic Health Records (EHRs): 
o	Application: Digital systems for comprehensive recording and management of patient information, including antenatal history, labour and delivery details, postpartum care, and laboratory results.
o	Relevance to Maternal Deaths: Facilitates early identification of risk factors (e.g., history of pre-eclampsia, previous haemorrhage), enables timely access to critical information during emergencies, supports informed decision-making, and improves continuity of care across different stages of pregnancy and childbirth.
•	Teleconsultation and Remote Monitoring: 
o	Application: Utilizing video conferencing, mobile apps, and wearable sensors to conduct remote consultations, monitor vital signs (e.g., blood pressure, foetal heart rate), and provide timely advice, especially for women with high-risk pregnancies or those in postpartum recovery.   
o	Relevance to Maternal Deaths: Enables early detection of complications like pre-eclampsia or postpartum haemorrhage, facilitates timely interventions, reduces delays in seeking care, and improves access to specialist consultations, particularly in resource-limited settings.   
•	Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS): 
o	Application: Integrating algorithms and evidence-based guidelines into digital platforms to provide clinicians with real-time alerts, reminders for essential interventions (e.g., administration of uterotonics after delivery), and diagnostic support for conditions like eclampsia or sepsis.
o	Relevance to Maternal Deaths: Helps standardize care according to best practices, reduces errors of omission, supports timely and appropriate management of obstetric emergencies, and enhances the confidence and skills of healthcare providers, especially in understaffed settings.
•	Mobile Health (mHealth) for Patient Education and Engagement: 
o	Application: Using SMS messaging, mobile apps, and interactive voice response (IVR) systems to provide pregnant women and new mothers with crucial information on danger signs, adherence to medication, breastfeeding practices, and postnatal care.   
o	Relevance to Maternal Deaths: Empowers women to recognize early warning signs of complications (e.g., severe bleeding, fever), promotes timely seeking of care, improves adherence to essential medications (e.g., iron supplementation), and supports healthy behaviours that can prevent complications.
2.3.2 Key Implementations, Successes, and Misses
Several implementations of digitized systems in hospital-based maternal health care offer valuable insight
Electronic Portogram Systems
Digital tools for real-time monitoring and visualization of labour progress, including foetal heart rate, uterine contractions, and maternal vital signs.
•	Key Successes
Studies have shown that electronic portograms can improve adherence to labour management protocols, facilitate earlier identification of prolonged or obstructed labour, and reduce the need for unnecessary interventions. Real-time data visualization aids in timely decision-making regarding interventions like assisted delivery or Caesarean section.   
•	Possible Misses
Implementation can be challenging in settings with limited infrastructure or intermittent power supply. User training and ensuring consistent data entry are crucial for effectiveness. Over-reliance on the digital tool without clinical judgment can also be a potential pitfall. 
Mobile-Based Antenatal and Postnatal Care Support
Utilizing SMS or mobile applications to send reminders for antenatal visits, provide educational messages on nutrition and danger signs, and facilitate postpartum follow-up and support for breastfeeding.   
•	Key Successes
Studies have demonstrated improved antenatal care attendance, increased awareness of danger signs leading to earlier care-seeking, and enhanced postpartum support, potentially contributing to the prevention of complications like postpartum infections and haemorrhage.
•	Possible Misses
Effectiveness can be limited by mobile phone ownership and literacy levels within the target population. Generic messaging may not address individual needs, and the lack of direct interaction might miss critical clinical cues. Data privacy concerns and the need for secure data transmission are also important considerations.
Telemedicine for Specialist Consultations in Remote Hospitals:
Using video conferencing and secure communication platforms to connect healthcare providers in rural or underserved hospitals with specialists (e.g., obstetricians) in central facilities for consultations on complex cases.
•	Key Successes
Improved access to specialist expertise in settings where it is scarce, facilitating better management of high-risk pregnancies and obstetric emergencies, potentially reducing the need for risky and time-consuming patient transfers.   
•	Possible Misses
Requires reliable internet connectivity and appropriate technology at both ends. Building trust and rapport remotely can be challenging. Clear protocols for when and how to utilize telemedicine are essential, and it cannot fully replace in-person examination and intervention when needed.
Integrated Hospital Information Systems with Clinical Decision Support:
Comprehensive digital systems that integrate patient records, laboratory results, imaging, and clinical guidelines to provide real-time alerts and recommendations to healthcare providers.
•	Key Successes
Can lead to improved adherence to evidence-based practices, early detection of deviations from normal parameters (e.g., rising blood pressure in pre-eclampsia), and timely administration of essential medications. Automated alerts for potential drug interactions or contraindications can also enhance patient safety.   
•	Possible Misses
High implementation costs, the need for seamless integration across different hospital departments and systems, and the risk of "alert fatigue" if the system generates too many non-critical alerts. Customization to local context and continuous updating of clinical guidelines are crucial for sustained effectiveness.
By examining these diverse applications and their outcomes, we can gain a deeper understanding of the potential of digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems to address direct causes of maternal deaths, while also acknowledging the challenges and limitations that need to be carefully considered during implementation and scaling up.
2.4 Integration and Architecture
2.4.1 Integration Options for Digitized Maternal Health Care
Integrating new digital tools with existing hospital infrastructure and workflows is crucial for successful implementation and adoption. Several integration approaches can be considered:
1.	Modular Integration: This approach involves implementing new digital components as independent modules that interact with existing systems through standardized interfaces (e.g., APIs - Application Programming Interfaces).
o	Example: Integrating a mobile health application for patient communication and remote monitoring with the hospital's Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The mHealth app can send patient-reported data (e.g., blood pressure readings) to the EHR via an API, and the EHR can send appointment reminders to the app.   
o	Advantages: Allows for phased implementation, reduces disruption to existing systems, facilitates interoperability between different vendors and technologies, and enables easier upgrades and maintenance of individual components.
o	Considerations: Requires well-defined APIs and data exchange standards to ensure seamless communication and data integrity. Careful planning is needed to manage data mapping and synchronization between different systems.
2.	Platform-Based Integration: This involves adopting a unified digital platform that offers a range of functionalities relevant to maternal health care, such as EHR, scheduling, communication tools, and decision support.
o	Example: Implementing a comprehensive hospital information system (HIS) with integrated modules for antenatal care, labour and delivery management, postpartum care, and patient communication.
o	Advantages: Provides a consistent user experience, simplifies data management by centralizing information, and can offer tighter integration between different functionalities.
o	Considerations: Can involve a significant upfront investment and may require replacing existing systems. Vendor lock-in and the complexity of customizing a large platform are potential challenges.
3.	Hybrid Integration: This approach combines elements of modular and platform-based integration, leveraging existing robust systems while adding specialized digital tools for specific needs.
o	Example: Maintaining an existing EHR system while integrating a third-party telemedicine platform for remote consultations and a separate mobile app for patient education.
o	Advantages: Allows hospitals to leverage their existing investments while adopting best-of-breed solutions for specific functionalities. Offers flexibility in choosing the most suitable tools for different needs.
o	Considerations: Requires careful planning to ensure interoperability between disparate systems. Managing data exchange and user access across multiple platforms can be complex.
2.4.2 Possible Design Architectures and Frameworks
Several architectural patterns and frameworks can guide the design and implementation of integrated digitized maternal health care systems:
1.	Client-Server Architecture: A traditional model where client applications (e.g., web browsers, mobile apps) communicate with a central server that stores data and provides services. Clinicians using web-based EHR interfaces to access patient records stored on a central hospital server. Patients using mobile apps to send data to and receive information from the server. It requires a reliable network infrastructure and robust server capacity to handle concurrent user access. Data security and privacy are critical considerations for the central server.
2.	Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): An architectural style that structures applications as a collection of loosely coupled services that communicate with each other, often using standardized protocols (e.g., REST, SOAP). Different functionalities like appointment scheduling, lab results viewing, and remote monitoring can be implemented as independent services that can be accessed and combined by various client applications (e.g., a clinician portal, a patient mobile app). It promotes reusability and flexibility, making it easier to integrate new services and adapt to changing needs. Requires careful design of service interfaces and management of service interactions.   
3.	Microservices Architecture: An evolution of SOA where applications are broken down into even smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Implementing individual microservices for specific functionalities like vital sign monitoring, medication reminders, and emergency alerts. These services can communicate via lightweight protocols. It offers high scalability and resilience, as the failure of one service does not affect others. However, it introduces complexity in managing a large number of distributed services and ensuring inter-service communication.
4.	Data-Centric Architecture: An architecture that prioritizes the management and flow of data. Different components and services are designed to interact with a central data repository. A central data warehouse containing all patient data (EHR, monitoring data, outcomes) that can be accessed and analysed by various applications for clinical decision support, reporting, and research. It emphasizes data quality, security, and governance. Requires a robust data management strategy and tools for data integration, storage, and analysis.
5.	Cloud-Based Architectures: Leveraging cloud computing platforms for hosting applications, storing data, and providing services. Deploying EHR systems, telemedicine platforms, and mHealth applications on cloud infrastructure. It offers scalability, cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go), and reduced infrastructure management burden. However, data security, privacy, and regulatory compliance in the cloud are critical concerns.
The choice of integration strategy and architecture will depend on various factors, including the existing infrastructure, budget, technical expertise, scalability requirements, and the specific needs of the hospital and the target population. A well-planned integration and a robust architectural framework are essential for building effective and sustainable digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems that can significantly contribute to reducing direct causes of maternal deaths.

This literature review has explored the burgeoning field of digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems and their potential to combat direct causes of maternal deaths. The review highlighted the critical role of timely and appropriate interventions in preventing these deaths and examined how various digital technologies are being integrated into hospital settings to achieve this goal.
The theoretical review established the key concepts underpinning this area, including digitization, maternal mortality, direct obstetric causes, and the role of various digital technologies like EHRs, mHealth, telemedicine, and CDSS. It further categorized these technologies based on their primary functions – data management, communication and remote monitoring, and decision support – outlining their respective advantages and limitations. This theoretical grounding provided a framework for understanding the potential impact and challenges associated with these digital interventions.
The case study review illustrated the diverse applications of digitized systems across the continuum of hospital-based maternal health care. Examples such as electronic portograms, mobile-based antenatal and postnatal support, telemedicine for specialist consultations, and integrated hospital information systems with clinical decision support demonstrated the potential for improved labor management, enhanced patient engagement, increased access to expertise, and better adherence to evidence-based practices. While highlighting successes in early detection of complications, improved communication, and enhanced decision-making, the review also acknowledged challenges related to infrastructure limitations, user adoption, data privacy, and the need for careful implementation and continuous evaluation.
The integration and architecture section delved into strategies for incorporating digital solutions within existing hospital systems, including modular, platform-based, and hybrid approaches. It also discussed various architectural frameworks like client-server, service-oriented, microservices, data-centric, and cloud-based architectures, outlining their relevance and considerations for building robust and scalable digitized maternal health care systems. The emphasis was on the need for interoperability, data security, and a well-planned architectural foundation to ensure effective implementation and sustainability.
2.6 Research Gaps
Despite the growing body of literature on digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems, several critical research gaps remain that hinder the widespread and effective implementation of these technologies to combat direct causes of maternal deaths. This research aims to address some of these key gaps:
1. Limited Evidence on the Direct Impact on Maternal Mortality
While many studies demonstrate the positive effects of digitized systems on intermediate outcomes (e.g., improved data accuracy, increased adherence to guidelines, better communication), there is often a lack of robust, large-scale studies directly linking the implementation of specific digitized interventions to a measurable reduction in maternal mortality rates due to direct obstetric causes within hospital settings.
This research will focus on analyzing existing evidence and potentially proposing frameworks for future studies that can establish a clearer causal link between specific digitized interventions (e.g., integrated EHRs with real-time alerts for hemorrhage, telemedicine for timely management of eclampsia in remote settings) and reductions in mortality rates from these conditions within hospital environments. This will involve exploring methodologies for controlling confounding factors and attributing outcomes to specific digital interventions.
2. Insufficient Understanding of Implementation Challenges in Diverse Low-Resource Settings
Much of the existing research originates from high-income countries or well-resourced settings within low- and middle-income countries. There is a relative paucity of in-depth studies exploring the specific implementation challenges, barriers, and facilitators in resource-constrained hospital environments with limited infrastructure, intermittent power supply, low digital literacy among healthcare workers and patients, and cultural nuances.
This research will specifically focus on understanding the contextual factors that influence the successful adoption and sustainability of digitized maternal health care systems in diverse low-resource hospital settings. It will explore strategies for overcoming these challenges, including the use of appropriate technologies (e.g., low-bandwidth solutions, offline capabilities), tailored training programs, community engagement strategies, and sustainable funding models.
3. Lack of Comprehensive Evaluation of Integrated Systems
Many studies focus on the impact of individual digital tools (e.g., a specific mHealth app or an electronic portogram). There is a need for more research evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated digitized systems that combine multiple tools and data streams to provide a holistic approach to maternal care within hospitals. This includes understanding how different digital components interact and contribute synergistically to improved outcomes.
This research will explore the concept of integrated digitized maternal health care systems and analyze the potential benefits of combining various technologies (e.g., EHRs integrated with CDSS and mHealth platforms). It will investigate existing models of integrated systems and propose frameworks for evaluating their overall impact on the quality and safety of maternal care and their contribution to reducing direct causes of mortality.
4. Limited Exploration of User-Centered Design and Adoption
The success of any digitized system heavily relies on its usability and acceptance by healthcare providers and pregnant women. There is a need for more research that applies user-centered design principles to the development and implementation of these systems, ensuring they are intuitive, meet the needs of end-users, and are seamlessly integrated into existing workflows. Understanding the factors that influence user adoption and adherence is also crucial.
This research will emphasize the importance of user-centered design in the development of digitized maternal health care systems. It will explore methodologies for involving healthcare providers and pregnant women in the design process and for evaluating the usability and acceptability of different digital tools. Furthermore, it will investigate strategies to promote user adoption and address potential resistance to technological change.
5. Insufficient Attention to Equity and Ethical Considerations
There is a risk that the implementation of digitized systems could exacerbate existing health inequities if not carefully planned and implemented. Issues such as the digital divide, data privacy, security, and algorithmic bias need to be thoroughly addressed. Research on the ethical implications of using digital technologies in maternal health care, particularly in vulnerable populations, is still evolving.
This research will explicitly address the ethical and equity considerations associated with digitized maternal health care systems. It will explore potential biases in algorithms, discuss strategies for ensuring equitable access and use of these technologies across different socioeconomic groups, and analyze frameworks for protecting patient data privacy and security within these digital environments.
By focusing on these identified research gaps, this literature review aims to contribute to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of how digitized hospital-based maternal health care systems can be effectively leveraged to combat direct causes of maternal deaths, particularly in resource-limited settings, while ensuring equitable access and ethical implementation. The insights gained from this review will help guide future research and inform the development and deployment of impactful digital health interventions in maternal health.
CHAPTER THREE: SYSTEM ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

3.1 Introduction

This chapter visualizes the strategic transition from 'what' the system aims to achieve to 'how' it will effectively address the persistent challenge of maternal mortality. Building upon the foundational problem statement – namely, the preventable nature of many maternal deaths through timely intervention and improved data management – this chapter is meant to improve the understanding of the challenges of current maternal healthcare workflows, identifying specific pain points, and translating these insights into a robust, user-centric, and technically feasible system design. It is designed to cover the feasibility study, requirements elicitation, data analysis, system specification, requirement analysis and modeling, the logical design of the system and the system’s physical design.
This chapter is not only about technical specifications; it is about crafting a solution that aligns directly with the goal of saving lives. By systematically analyzing existing processes and carefully designing the digital infrastructure, the researcher aims to create a system that facilitates early detection of complications like Post-Partum Hemorrhage, Eclampsia, and Sepsis, automates critical alerts, and ultimately empowers healthcare teams to provide prompt, life-saving interventions. The researcher anticipates this chapter to be highly collaborative, iterative, and foundational to the successful development and eventual deployment of a system that can significantly contribute to reducing maternal mortality rates in Kenya thereby enhancing maternal and child health outcomes.

3.2 Systems Development Methodology

The researcher used Iterative and Incremental Development Methodology, applying principles of the Agile approach with elements of Prototyping and a strong focus on Human-Centred Design (HCD). This choice was due to the unique complexities and critical nature of healthcare systems, where requirements can evolve, user adoption is important, and early validation is essential for patient safety and clinical efficacy. It also offers principles like prototyping, incremental development, continuous feedback and collaboration, adaptability to change and maintains focus on working software. Some of the main reasons for this Methodology were:
1.	Complexity and Evolving Requirements in Healthcare: Healthcare environments are dynamic. Clinical workflows, best practices, and even regulatory guidelines can change. A Waterfall approach, which requires all requirements to be fully defined upfront, would not accommodate the changing requirements in the research area. Iterative development allows for flexibility and adaptation as new insights are gained through continuous stakeholder engagement.
2.	Criticality and Risk Mitigation: The system directly impacts patient outcomes and aims to reduce maternal mortality. This high-stakes environment demands a methodology that allows for early identification and mitigation of risks. Through iterative cycles, critical functionalities can be developed and tested (like the risk assessment and alert system, and the digital partograph) in smaller increments, gather feedback, and refine them before full-scale implementation reducing the likelihood of major flaws or unforeseen complications.
3.	User Adoption and Human-centred Design: For this system to be effective, it must be intuitive and seamlessly integrate into the busy routines of healthcare professionals. A Human-Centred Design approach ensures that the end-users (doctors, nurses, and administrators) are actively involved throughout the development lifecycle. They shape the system, fostering usability, reducing resistance to change, and increasing adoption rates.
By adopting this flexible, user-centred, and risk-aware Systems Development Methodology, the researcher aims to deliver a high-quality, impactful Digitized Hospital-Based Maternal Care System that is not only technically sound but also practically usable and effective in its goal of reducing maternal mortality.

3.3 Feasibility Study

In order to understand the process as well as the applicability of the system, a feasibility study is crucial. Its purpose is to investigate the issues underlying the adoptability and applicability of the system in its operational environment. This was to determine if the system is viable and achievable. The study was done in various angles; economic, technical, operational, and other feasibility angles such as legal and ethical feasibility, and schedule feasibility, considering the potential challenges and opportunities of the system. The assessment was based on a comprehensive assessment, all pointing towards a successful adoption and contribution of this system.

•	Medical-Legal Compliance - The system will be designed to support clinical guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) recognized by the Ministry of Health, aiding healthcare workers in adhering to best practices and minimizing medical errors.
•	Ethical Considerations - Special attention will be paid to obtaining informed consent for data collection and use, ensuring data anonymity for research purposes, and designing alerts responsibly to support, not replace, clinical judgment.
Schedule Feasibility: Feasible
•	Defined Scope - The project has a well-defined scope (hospital-based, focus on maternal mortality reduction via specific features).
•	Phased Approach - The iterative and incremental methodology allows for the delivery of core functionalities within the typical academic timeline, with potential for future expansion.
•	Resource Allocation - With dedicated academic time, access to mentorship, and potentially available development tools, the schedule is achievable.
In conclusion, the proposal effectively demonstrates the multi-faceted feasibility of developing a Digitized Hospital-Based Maternal Care System. While acknowledging the challenges common to healthcare IT projects (e.g., funding for full-scale deployment, digital literacy, organizational change), the research's methodological approach, clear objectives, and focus on real-world impact position it as a highly viable and valuable endeavour.

3.4 Requirement Elicitation

This chapter involved systematic data collection to ensure the developed system directly addresses the identified problem, aligns the research objectives, and meets the practical needs of its intended users. As a first step in the data collection, pilot interviews were undertaken to check the validity of the schedule and interview questions, to determine the length of time it would take to perform the entire process, also to ensure both parties involved were comfortable with the process. Potential questions were initially identified from those individuals who showed willingness. A combination of observation, interviews and questionnaires was used. The questions provided were both open and close approach as a way of making the most time available while also collecting systematic data which is easier to analyse. 
Data Collection Tools and Administration
1.	Interviews 

An interview guide was prepared the consisted of open- ended questions for different stakeholders. The one for expectant mothers and mothers explored their current access to information, understanding of pregnancy danger signs, experiences with traditional care, perceived benefits of digital awareness and interest in peer support features. For Medically qualified personnel, the questions focused on current record keeping pain points, critical information needed for early complication detection, communication gaps between departments, availability of time to attend to expectant mothers in real-time, and desired features for this system. Friends and family main focus on the guide was to determine their role in supporting maternal health and information needs.
Interviews were conducted face-to-face or through scheduled virtual calls, ensuring a comfortable and confidential setting for the respondents to share their experiences and perspectives.

2.	Observation

The researcher developed a checklist to record specific activities, data points being collected, communication patterns, time taken for critical tasks and instances of delay or information gaps and their causes. Dedicated periods of observation routines of antenatal visits, labour progression, delivery and postnatal care were spent. This provided the contextual understanding that might not emerge from interviews alone.

3.	Questionnaires

Structured questionnaires were administered. They included a mix of close-ended and some open-ended questions. This was to capture data relevant to research objectives such as how digitized comprehensive awareness influence expectant mothers’ engagement and knowledge retention and effectiveness of interaction within expectant mothers and themselves. The questionnaires were administered in either paper format at healthcare facilities or digitally depending on the accessibility and preference of the target group. Clear instructions and explanations were provided.
Sampling Techniques and Sample Size
1.	Target Population
The target population for this research includes:
•	Expectant mothers (especially those facing challenges in early access to maternal healthcare).
•	Medically qualified personnel (doctors, nurses, midwives) working in hospital maternity departments.
•	Other mothers (who have given birth) to understand their experiences and potential for peer support.
•	Friends and family of expectant mothers.
•	Hospital administrators.
2.	Sampling Techniques Used
•	Purposive Sampling (for Interviews and Observations)
This non-probability sampling technique is a sampling done to pass a certain judgement and was primarily used to select key informants who possess specific knowledge and experiences directly relevant to the research questions. For example, experienced obstetricians, senior nurses in the labour ward, and mothers who have experienced complications were purposively selected to provide rich, in-depth insights into the "human failure" and "healthcare systems failure" aspects of maternal mortality. This ensures that the qualitative data collected is highly relevant and detailed.
•	Convenience/Snowball Sampling (for Questionnaires/Surveys)
For broader quantitative data on awareness and general challenges, convenience sampling (selecting participants who are readily available and willing to participate, e.g., at a hospital waiting area) was employed. Additionally, snowball sampling might be used to reach other mothers or community members by asking initial participants to refer others. While this may introduce some bias, it is a practical approach for a research project to gather a wider range of perspectives on awareness and engagement.
3.	Sample Size Determination
	For Qualitative Data (Interviews, Observations)
The sample size was not predetermined as a fixed number. Instead, interviews and observations continued until no new significant themes, insights, or information emerged from the respondents regarding maternal care challenges, digital system requirements, or perceptions of the proposed solution.
	For Quantitative Data (Questionnaires/Surveys)
The sample size for surveys was determined based on practicality such as accessibility of respondents, time constraints and available resources. The aim was to gather sufficient data to identify patterns, trends, and preferences relevant to deducing system requirements.
Alignment of Collected Data with the Problem and the Research Objectives 
The data collected through these diverse tools is meticulously aligned with the research problem and objectives, serving as the foundation for deducing robust system requirements:
Understanding the Problem (1.3 Problem Statement)
•	Unawareness & Stigmatization - Interview and survey data from expectant mothers directly reveal their current knowledge gaps, common misconceptions, and experiences with stigmatization, informing the need for personalized, interactive, and private educational content and peer support features.
•	Healthcare System Failures (Delays, Lack of Specialists, Information Transfer) - Interviews with medical personnel and observations of workflows highlight specific bottlenecks, communication breakdowns, and challenges with manual records that contribute to delays. This data is crucial for designing features like real-time alerts, integrated patient records, and secure communication channels between departments.
•	Unmonitored Complications (Eclampsia, Puerperal Sepsis, etc.) - Data on how these complications are currently managed, the information needed for early detection, and the current monitoring practices directly inform the design of the risk assessment module, digital partograph, and clinical decision support functionalities.
Deducing System Requirements (1.5 Research Objectives)
•	Objective 1 (Digitized Comprehensive Awareness) - Interview and survey data on feedback preferences, engagement levels, and knowledge retention directly translate into requirements for interactive content, real-time feedback mechanisms (from AI and personnel), and multilingual support.
•	Objective 2 (Hospital-Based Tool with Medical Personnel Guidance) - Insights from doctors and nurses on their workflows, data entry needs, desired communication tools, and the type of guidance they wish to provide digitally form the basis for the EHR, decision support, and secure messaging modules.
•	Objective 3 (Effectiveness of Interaction within Expectant Mothers) - Data on the benefits of peer support, preferred communication methods, and types of shared experiences inform the design of forums, support groups, and shared experience features within the platform.
In conclusion, every piece of data collected serves to inform the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, ensuring it is a relevant, effective and user-centric solution to reduce maternal mortality.
3.5 Data Analysis

The data collected through interviews, observations, and questionnaires was systematically analysed using Microsoft Excel and Python (Pandas). This approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding, triangulating findings from different data sources to strengthen the validity of the conclusions
Before analysis, all collected data underwent a thorough cleaning process:
•	Transcription - Audio recordings from interviews were accurately transcribed.
•	Coding - Open-ended responses from questionnaires and interview transcripts were systematically coded to identify recurring themes, concepts, and categories.
•	Data Entry and Verification - Quantitative data from questionnaires were entered into a digital format (Excel spreadsheet). A verification process was implemented to check for data entry errors and inconsistencies.
•	Handling Missing Values - Strategies for handling missing data points were determined (e.g., mean imputation) based on the nature and extent of missingness.
•	Anonymization - All personally identifiable information was removed or anonymized to ensure patient privacy and ethical compliance, as per the Kenya Data Protection Act, 2019.
3.5.1 Quantitative Data Analysis
Quantitative data, primarily derived from the questionnaires/surveys, was analysed using Microsoft Excel for initial data manipulation.
•	Descriptive Statistics
o	Frequencies and Percentages - Used to summarize categorical data, such as the proportion of expectant mothers aware of specific danger signs, the percentage of healthcare providers facing particular challenges with current systems, or the distribution of preferences for certain digital features.
o	Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode) – Summary statistics that represent the CenterPoint or a typical value of a distribution. They show where most of the data values fall.
o	Measures of Dispersion (Standard Deviation, Range) - Used to understand the spread or variability of responses.
3.5.2 Qualitative Data Analysis
Qualitative data from interviews and observations was analysed using Python. This systematic process involves:
•	Familiarization - Reading and re-reading transcripts and observation notes to become deeply immersed in the data.
•	Initial Coding - Generating initial codes from the data, identifying interesting features across the entire dataset.
•	Searching for Themes - Grouping similar codes together to form potential themes that capture important aspects of the data.
•	Reviewing Themes - Checking if the themes are coherent and consistent internally, and distinct externally. This involves refining themes, splitting them, or combining them.
•	Defining and Naming Themes - Developing clear definitions and names for each theme, and identifying compelling examples from the data to illustrate them.
•	Producing the Report - Weaving the themes together to tell a coherent and insightful story that addresses the research questions.
This qualitative analysis provided rich contextual understanding, explained the "why" behind quantitative findings, and uncovered nuances in user experiences and operational challenges that quantitative data alone might have missed.
3.5.3 Data Representation and Visualization
•	Pie Charts: Ideal for showing proportions or percentages of a whole.
Percentage distribution of primary causes of maternal mortality reported by healthcare providers.
 
•	Bar Graphs: Excellent for comparing discrete categories or showing frequencies.
A comparison of common issues such as:
•	Lack of Awareness
•	Transport Issues
•	Inadequate Staff
•	Cost of Services
•	Long Waiting Times
•	Cultural Beliefs 
It effectively compares categories like Lack of Awareness, Transport Issues and Inadequate Staff, which are key concerns in the maternal care system.
 
•	Line Graphs: Best for illustrating trends over time or relationships between continuous variables.
Showing trends in engagement with digital content over the pregnancy journey.
 

3.6 System Specification

This phase details and defines the requirements for the system outlining precisely what it should do and how well it should perform. These specifications are derived from the problem statement, research objectives and the insights gained during data collection and analysis phases, focusing on mitigating the direct causes of the maternal mortality in hospital setting in particular.
3.6.1 Functional requirements
They define the functions of a system or its components. They clearly state the specific actions the system must perform to achieve its objectives. They describe the system’s behaviour, features, and services from the user’s perspective.
I.	User Management
The system should allow stakeholders to register themselves with the administrators approving the registrations. It should allow them registration with unique credentials and assign them specific roles. The system shall enforce RBAC, ensuring users can only access functionalities and data relevant to their assigned roles. The users should also be able to view and update their personal profiles.
II.	Patient Management
The system should capture comprehensive demographic information as well as detailed maternal health record for each patient. It should allow for a quick search and retrieval of patient information using various ways.
III.	Risk Assessment and Alert System
The system should provide a calculated and updated risk score for the patients as well as information on the potential risks based on predefined criteria like history, etc. It should also provide real-time and immediate alerts to both the patient and health care providers to facilitate timely acknowledgment and action.
IV.	Communication and Collaboration
The system should provide secure messaging features for direct communication with healthcare providers and vice versa. It should also include a forum or support group feature where expectant mothers and other mothers can engage with each other, share experiences and seek support.
V.	Antenatal Care Module
The system should allow healthcare providers to schedule ANC appointments and generate reminders for patients. It will also allow them to record and track maternal vital signs. It shall also provide context-aware educational content on pregnancy stages, nutrition, exercise, and danger signs to expectant mothers.
VI.	Postnatal Care Module
The system should allow recording and tracking of maternal recovery parameters during postpartum period and recording of new born health status. It should also facilitate scheduling and reminders for postnatal check-ups for both the mother and the baby.
VII.	Labour and Delivery Module
The system should provide a digital partograph for real time monitoring and plotting of labour process. It will also flag deviations from normal labour progression.
3.6.2 Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements specify the criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than the specific behaviours. They specify the quality attributes of the system, defining how well the system performs its functions. Here, Usability, Security and Reliability of the system are crucial.
1.	Usability – The user interface should be a user-friendly, intuitive and easy to navigate, minimizing the learning curve for the stakeholders.
2.	Security – All sensitive data shall be encrypted both in the database and during communication. Authentication and authorization shall be used to enforce security.
3.	Reliability – This specifies the capability of the software to maintain its performance over time and under intolerable conditions. It should ensure integrity and consistency of all data, preventing corruption or loss.

6.	Compliance – The mechanisms used should be configurable to align with national and hospital-specific clinical guidelines for maternal care.

3.7 Requirement Analysis and Modelling

3.7.1 Dependencies 
They define the order in which functionalities must be implemented or how one feature relies on another.
i.	Patient Registration – All subsequent functionalities depend on a patient successfully registering in to the system. No maternal care data can be recorded without an existing patient record.
ii.	Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Every functional module’s accessibility and data manipulation capabilities depend on the user’s assigned role and the RBAC system.
iii.	Risk Assessment and Alert System – It heavily depends on accurate and timely data input from ANC, lab results, partograph, and patient history. Without that data, the alert system cannot function effectively.
3.7.2 Conflicts and Potential Solutions
 Conflicts occur when requirements contradict each other or when a desired feature clashes with a practical constraint.
i.	Extensive Data Collection vs Minimizing Data Entry Burden.
	Healthcare professionals are often time-constrained. A desire for comprehensive data (for robust analytics and alerts) can conflict with the need for quick, minimal data entry to avoid overwhelming users.
	Solution: Prioritize critical data points for mandatory entry. Implement smart forms with pre-filled fields, dropdowns, and automated calculations. 

ii.	Real-time Data and Alerts vs Intermittent Connectivity/ Infrastructure Limitations
	The need for real-time alerts (PERF-002) and continuous monitoring clashes with potential network instability or limited power in some hospital settings.
	Solution: Design for partial offline capability where critical data can be captured locally and synchronized when connectivity is restored. Implement robust data queues and synchronization logic.

iii.	Comprehensive Features vs Project Budget
	The desire for a feature-rich system might exceed the allocated time and budget for a final year project.
	Solution: Prioritize core functionalities (e.g., patient registration, basic ANC, digital partograph, critical alerts for PPH/Eclampsia) for the initial prototype (Minimum Viable Product - MVP). Features like advanced AI agents or full integration with all external hospital systems can be deferred to future phases.

3.8 Logical Design 

The logical design phase focused on abstracting the system's functionality and data flow, independent of specific implementation technologies. It captures the "what" and "how" at a conceptual level, ensuring that the system's structure supports its objectives of enhancing maternal care and reducing mortality.
3.8.1 System Architecture
The system will adopt a Layered Architecture pattern, a well-established approach for enterprise applications due to its benefits in terms of separation of concerns, maintainability, scalability, and security. This architecture clearly defines distinct responsibilities for each layer, promoting modularity and making the system easier to develop, test, and evolve.
Structure and Organization
1.	Presentation Layer (Client Layer) – For User interaction, displaying information, capturing user input. Web-based user interfaces (for smartphones/desktop/tablet access by expectant mothers, healthcare providers and administrators). Technologies (Conceptual): Web browser and JavaScript react js framework.
2.	Application/Business Logic Layer - Implements the core business rules, processes, and functionalities (e.g., patient registration logic, partograph calculations, risk assessment algorithms, alert generation). It acts as the intermediary between the Presentation and Data Access Layers. Python for the backend programming.
Components:
	User & Security Management Service - Handles authentication, authorization, and user role management.
	Patient Management Service - Manages patient profiles, medical history, and demographic data.
	Maternal Care Workflow Services
	ANC Management Service - Logic for antenatal visit data capture, scheduling.
	Labour & Delivery Management Service - Logic for partograph processing, delivery details.
	PNC Management Service - Logic for postnatal care data.
	Risk Assessment & Alerting Engine - Implements algorithms for risk scoring and alert generation.
	Communication & Collaboration Service - Manages internal messaging and peer support forums.
	Reporting & Analytics Service - Processes data for reports and dashboards.
3.	Data Access Layer - Provides a simplified and secure interface for the Application Layer to interact with the database. It abstracts the complexities of database operations (CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete). Database connectors, Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) or data access objects (DAOs). SQLAlchemy for Python.
4.	Data Layer (Database Layer) – For persistent storage and retrieval of all system data. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Technologies, MySQL.
Architectural Pattern considered was Client-Server: This is the fundamental pattern underlying the layered architecture, with clients (web browsers/apps) requesting services from a central server.
3.8.2 Control Flow and Process Design
Control flow defines the sequence of operations and decisions within the system.
 

3.9 Physical Design

The physical design stage focuses on the tangible aspects of the system, transforming the logical blueprint into a detailed plan for implementation. This involves selecting specific hardware and software platforms, defining database structures, designing user interfaces, and outlining deployment considerations.
